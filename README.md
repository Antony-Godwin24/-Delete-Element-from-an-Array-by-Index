# -Delete-Element-from-an-Array-by-Index
This Java program deletes an element from an array at a specified index. It first takes the array size and elements as input. The user then provides the index to delete. The program creates a new array, copies all elements except the one at the given index, and prints the updated array. If the index is invalid, it may cause an error.
